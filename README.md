## Volunteer Assistance System

The Volunteer Assistance System is a Node.js server-side application that aims to streamline the coordination process between volunteers and help seekers.
- List of pending assistance requests
- Volunteer sign-up functionality
- Volunteer management
The system utilizes MongoDB for data storage, ensuring efficient data management.
Following REST principles, the system's API design focuses on providing a consistent and predictable interface for interacting with the server.

The codebase is structured into separate modules to enhance maintainability and readability:
     **Database Interactions:** Handles interactions with the MongoDB database.
     **Business Logic:** Implements the core logic of the application.
     **Client-Facing APIs:** Manages the APIs exposed to the client.

This repository contains a Postman collection with all the APIs along with sample data for testing purposes.
